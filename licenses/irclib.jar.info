IRClib requires Java Runtime Environment 1.2 or later. It requires
JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extensions) until J2RE 1.3; J2RE 1.4 already
includes JSSE and hence doesn't require JSSE. You can download JSSE

<p>
By instantiating the <code>{@link org.schwering.irc.lib.IRCConnection}</code> 
class you can establish a new connection to an IRC server. The 
<code>{@link org.schwering.irc.lib.IRCEventListener}</code> informs your class 
about lines coming from the server which are parsed by the 
<code>{@link org.schwering.irc.lib.IRCParser}</code>. The 
<code>{@link org.schwering.irc.lib.IRCModeParser}</code> is especially made for 
channel-modes.<br />
To create a secure connection with SSL, instantiate the 
<code>{@link org.schwering.irc.lib.ssl.SSLIRCConnection}</code>.
