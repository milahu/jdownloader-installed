Download Java Image Processing Classes

The classes on this web site are available for download in source code form. If you want to play with the filters, I would strongly recommend downloading the Image Editor. This has customizer dialogs for almost every filter, allowing you to vary all the filter parameters and see the results immediately.
Download Filters.zip.
Building

The filters are in source form with an Ant build file. Unpack Filter.jar, go to the Filters folder and type "ant" or just build the filters in whichever way you find comfortable.
